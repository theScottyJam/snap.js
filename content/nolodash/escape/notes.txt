I'm choosing to name the escapeHtmlChars() because browsers already supply an escape() function, and I don't want to encourage shadowinging it. Besides, escapeHtmlChars() is much clearer anyways.

This function can also be found under "template"'s entry, but it has been renamed to "esc()". Similar explanations can also be found there.
