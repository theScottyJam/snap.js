## Parameters

- `tagName`

  The new element's tag

- `attrs`

  A mapping of attribute names to values

- `children`

  A list of child nodes. A child can either be a string or an HTML element (e.g. one generated by el()).

## Examples

```javascript
el('div', { id: 'my-div' }, [
  el('span', {}, ['Hello']),
  'World!',
])

/* The above results in the following HTML structure
<div id="my-div">
  <span>Hello</span>
  World!
</div>
*/
```

## Additional Information

`el()` can be useful for quick-and-dirty HTML-building, but it won't help you write code that automatically reacts to state changes. If you need that level of reactivity, consider reaching for a proper framework instead. If you need something lightweight and transparent, consider using [the Snap Framework](#!/framework), otherwise, there's plenty of other frameworks out there to choose from.
