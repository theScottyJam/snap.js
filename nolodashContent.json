If you don't do any data validation, then don't worry about it - a sparse array would result in undefined behavior, the same way any other bad input would.

the same algorithm that is provided to you natively with the `structuredClone()` function. The structured clone algorithm can be useful for simpler scenarios, but it has severe limitations that you should be aware of:\n* many objects, such as `ArrayBuffer` instances, will have ownership of their data transferred to their clone, rendering the original unusable. A complete list of transferable objects can be found [on MDN's website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Transferable_objects#supported_objects).\n* Some values, like functions, can not be cloned.\n* Some objects lose data when they get cloned. This includes the prototypes of most objects (making it impossible to properly clone instances of any userland class), getters and setters, some data stored on regular expression instances, etc.\n\nFor a complete reference to the algorithm's limitations, please refer to the [structured clone algorithm page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) on MDN.\n\nIf `structuredClone()` doesn't suit your needs (because, e.g., maybe you have userland instances that you wish to clone), you'll have to build up your own cloning algorithm by hand, according to your use-case. Here's a simple version to get you started - it shows examples of how you would deep-clone a handful of different types of data. It's up to you to add or remove functionality as needed. Note that this version does not support circular references - if you need to support that, you'll additionally need to keep around a set containing each value you've visited to make sure you're not going in a loop.\n\n```javascript\nconst isObject = value => ['object', 'function'].includes(typeof value) && value !== null;\n\nfunction cloneDeep(value) {\n  if (!isObject(value)) {\n    // It's a primitive, which is immutable, so we don't need to clone it.\n    return value;\n  }\n\n  if (Array.isArray(value)) {\n    return value.map(cloneDeep);\n  } else if (value instanceof Map) {\n    return new Map(\n      [...value].map(([key, value]) => [cloneDeep(key), cloneDeep(value)])\n    );\n  } else if (value instanceof Set) {\n    return new Set(\n      [...value].map(x => cloneDeep(x))\n    );\n  } else if (Object.getPrototypeOf(value) === Object.prototype) {\n    return Object.fromEntries(\n      Object.entries(value).map(([key, value]) => [key, cloneDeep(value)])\n    );\n  } else if (Object.getPrototypeOf(value) === null) {\n    const newObject = Object.fromEntries(\n      Object.entries(value).map(([key, value]) => [key, cloneDeep(value)])\n    );\n    Object.setPrototypeOf(newObject, null);\n    return newObject;\n  } else {\n    throw new Error(`Can not clone an instance of ${value.constructor?.name}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isArguments","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isArguments(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isArguments","summary":"Checks if `value` is likely an `arguments` object."},"description":"```javascript\nfunction isArguments(value) {\n  return Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Arguments]' && !(Symbol.toStringTag in value);\n}\n```\n\nThe above solution can technically give wrong answers if you provide an arguments object that has been mutated to contain `Symbol.toStringTag`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction() {\n  arguments[Symbol.toStringTag] = 'badValue';\n  isArguments(arguments); // false\n}\n```\n\nEven Lodash's implementation can be spoofed, but under different conditions.

In many cases this sort of thing isn't something you need to worry about, but if you want to prevent subclasses and/or `Array.prototype` from getting through there's various solutions you can use depending on how robust you need the solution to be.\n\n1. `Object.getPrototypeOf(value) === Array.prototype` is the simplest way to exclude `Array.prototype` and inherited instances, but has issues with cross-realm arrays (see footnote 1) and `Object.create(Array.prototype)` (see footnote 2).\n2. `Array.isArray(value) && Object.getPrototypeOf(value) === Array.prototype` is a little more robust and solved the `Object.create(Array.prototype)` issue (footnote 2), but still has issues with cross-realm arrays (footnote 1).\n3. The helper function below would be the strongest solution, and doesn't have any of the issues that the simpler solutions have.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Cross realm compatible is-non-inherited-array check.\n    function isNonInheritedArray(value) {\n      const protoOf = Object.getPrototypeOf;\n      // An array's prototype chain should normally be\n      // value -> Array.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null\n      // If there's an extra link in there, it means inheritance has happened.\n      return (\n        Array.isArray(value) &&\n        protoOf(protoOf(value)) !== null && // This check fails if you pass in Array.prototype.\n        protoOf(protoOf(protoOf(value))) === null\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. If you just want to exclude `Array.prototype` and still allow subclasses, then you can use solution 3, but omit the last `protoOf(protoOf(protoOf(value))) === null` check.\n\nFootnotes:\n1. A \"cross-realm array\" is, for example, an array from an iframe. Since the Array class from within the iframe is separate from the Array class outside of the iframe, you can't simply do an equality check on their prototypes.\n2. The problem with `Object.create(Array.prototype)` is that this does not create a real array, it's just an object who's prototype happens to be `Array.prototype`.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isArrayBuffer","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isArrayBuffer(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isArrayBuffer","summary":"Checks if `value` is classified as an `ArrayBuffer` object."},"description":"To check if your value is an instance of `ArrayBuffer`:\n\n```javascript\nvalue instanceof ArrayBuffer;\n```\n\nThe above should be good enough for the vast majority of use-cases.\n\nIt's generally considered a bad practice to subclass built-ins, but if you suspect that a subclass might be handed to you and you wish to exclude subclasses from your check, you can compare prototypes like this:\n\n```javascript\nObject.getPrototypeOf(value) === ArrayBuffer.prototype;\n```\n\nBoth of the above type-detection mechanisms have a couple of flaws:\n1. they don't work with cross-realm values. For example, if you receive an instance of an `ArrayBuffer` from across an iframe boundary, that instance's prototype would link to the iframe's `ArrayBuffer` class, not your `ArrayBuffer` class, and both of the above checks would fail to recognize it as an ArrayBuffer.\n2. They will state that `Object.create(ArrayBuffer.prototype)` is an `ArrayBuffer`, but it's not. It's just a regular object who's prototype has been set to `ArrayBuffer.prototype`.\n\nBoth of these issues can be solved with a helper function like this:\n\n```javascript\n// An isArrayBuffer() check that supports cross-realm ArrayBuffers.\nfunction isArrayBuffer(value) {\n  try {\n    // If you call an ArrayBuffer method, like .slice(),\n    // with a \"this\" value that's anything\n    // other than an ArrayBuffer, a TypeError is thrown.\n    ArrayBuffer.prototype.slice.call(value, 0, 0);\n    return true;\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error instanceof TypeError) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you additionally need to ensure that you are not receiving an ArrayBuffer instance from an inherited class, you'd also need to walk up the prototype chain. You can modify the above example and replace `return true;` with the following:\n\n```javascript\n// A ArrayBuffer's prototype's chain should be\n// value -> ArrayBuffer.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null\n// If it's not, then we're dealing with an ArrayBuffer subclass.\nconst protoOf = Object.getPrototypeOf;\nreturn protoOf(protoOf(protoOf(value))) === null;\n```\n\nLodash's `_.isArrayBuffer()` also supports cross-realm ArrayBuffer checks, but it uses a less robust algorithm that can be easily fooled. For example, if you run Lodash in the browser, the following will return the wrong answer.\n\n```javascript\n_.isArrayBuffer({ get [Symbol.toStringTag]() { return 'ArrayBuffer' } }); // true\n```\n\nIn Node, Lodash will instead use `require('util').types.isArrayBuffer(value)` for it's implementation, which you are also welcome to use if you know your code will only run in Node.\n\nSome very early JavaScript proposals may provide support for more ergonomic ways to do cross-realm type checking:\n* [istypes](https://github.com/jasnell/proposal-istypes)\n* [Pattern matching's built-in matchers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching#built-in-custom-matchers-1)\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isArrayLike","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isArrayLike(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isArrayLike","summary":"Checks if `value` is array-like.

This means that even `{}` is \"array-like\", because it's able to get the (non-existent) length property (`undefined`), then coerce that into an integer (`0`). This definition technically makes almost any value except undefined, null, and a couple of other minor edge cases \"array-like\". A good way to check if something is considered array-like or not per the spec, is to run the following snippet and see if it throws an error, if it does not, your value is an array-like value.\n\n```javascript\nArray.prototype.slice.call(<your value>);\n```\n\nIn day-to-day conversation the term \"array-like\" goes beyond the technical definition of array-like as outlined by the spec.

The point is that Lodash's implementation isn't the only correct way to implement this check - depending on your use-case you might find that a different `isArrayLikeObject()` implementation would be more appropriate.\n\nAn even better lesson from all of this is that if you're tempted to design a function that behaves differently depending on if an input value is an array-like object or not, it might be worthwhile to reconsider the API design so you don't have to make your public API depend on either a non-standard or overly loose definition of \"array-like object\".\n","src":null,"test":"function isArrayLikeObject(value) {\n  return isArrayLike(value) && isObject(value);\n}\n\nfunction isArrayLike(value) {\n  return (\n    typeof value !== 'function' &&\n    Number.isInteger(value?.length) &&\n    value.length >= 0\n  );\n}\n\nfunction isObject(value) {\n  return value === Object(value);\n}\n\ndescribe('isArrayLikeObject()', () => {\n  it('considers an array to be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject([2, 3])).toBe(true);\n  });\n\n  it('does not considers a string to be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject('23')).toBe(false);\n  });\n\n  it('considers an arguments object to be an array-like object', () => {\n    (function () {\n      expect(isArrayLikeObject(arguments)).toBe(true);\n    })();\n  });\n\n  it('does not consider a function to be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject(function () {})).toBe(false);\n  });\n\n  it('considers a value missing a length property to not be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject({})).toBe(false);\n  });\n\n  it('considers a value with a positive integer length to be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject({ length: 2 })).toBe(true);\n  });\n\n  it('considers a value with the length 0 to be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject({ length: 0 })).toBe(true);\n  });\n\n  it('considers a value with a string length to not be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject({ length: '2' })).toBe(false);\n  });\n\n  it('considers a value with a length of Infinity to not be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject({ length: Infinity })).toBe(false);\n  });\n\n  it('considers a value with a length of NaN to not be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject({ length: NaN })).toBe(false);\n  });\n\n  it('considers a value with a float length to not be an array-like object', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject({ length: 2.3 })).toBe(false);\n  });\n\n  it('considers a value with a really large length to not be an array-like object (as those are represented as floats)', () => {\n    expect(isArrayLikeObject({ length: 2e999 })).toBe(false);\n  });\n});\n"},{"name":"isBoolean","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isBoolean(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isBoolean","summary":"Checks if `value` is classified as a boolean primitive or object."},"description":"To check if a value is a boolean primitive:\n\n```javascript\ntypeof value === 'boolean';\n```\n\nThe above should be good enough for the vast majority of use-cases.\n\nLodash will also check if the value is a boolean object.

This distinction is technically nonsense. Only containers can be empty. If your piece of data can't hold anything, then it _can't_ be empty or non-empty, instead it's simply an invalid input. It's true that a `null` or `undefined` can be used to represent the absence of a value, but these pieces of data aren't in-and-of-themselves _empty_.

Take, for example, `{ length: 0 }`, which is an array-like object (it passes Lodash's `_.isArrayLike()` check), however, when passed into `_.isEmpty()`, Lodash will incorrectly state that this array-like value is not empty. The reason for this odd behavior is simply because this function has been overloaded with too many behaviors - while it's true that `{ length: 0 }` is an empty array-like object, it's also true that this is not an empty object, and Lodash has decided to let the \"is this an empty object\" behavior take precedence over the \"is this an empty array-like value\" behavior for this specific scenario.

Some probing shows that it's an instance of an internal \"Stack\" class that provides some methods which, presumably, can be used to gather information about the objects you're comparing. Due to the fact that this seems to be a rather complex feature that's entirely undocumented, it'll be assumed that the vast majority of users do not use this parameter, and so it's functionality won't be recreated here either.\n\nSpecial data types, like Maps and Sets, are not supported in the above example. This is partly because Lodash chooses to support them in a slightly odd way that you may not wish to mirror. For example:\n* The fourth or fifth argument to your customizer function is supposed to be the parent node, but if that parent node was a `Map` or `Set` instance, you'll instead receive arrays containing the node's contents (e.g. a map of usernames to ids would be turned into `[['Sally', 1], ['Zack', 2]]` before being provided to you).\n* When comparing two sets, like `new Set([1, 2, 3, 4])` and `new Set([5, 6, 7, 8])`, its going to call your `customizer` function _16_ different times (assuming the `customizer` function returns `false` or `undefined` each time). As your sets grow in length, the amount of times it has to call your customizer grows exponentially. Maps have a similar issue. This behavior is required to implement the general-purpose algorithm Lodash was going for, but maybe for your use-case you don't need your algorithm to be so general-purpose - maybe you can cut some corners to help with performance.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isError","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isError(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isError","summary":"Checks if value is an `Error`, `EvalError`, `RangeError`, `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, or `URIError` object."},"description":"Lodash's documentation makes it sound like they're checking if the value is specifically an instance of a set of built-in errors, but in reality, they're considering any [non-plain object](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isPlainObject) that has `message` and `name` properties that are strings to be errors.

You can modify the above example and replace `return true;` with the following:\n\n```javascript\n// A Map's prototype's chain should be\n// value -> Map.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null\n// If it's not, then we're dealing with a Map subclass.\nconst protoOf = Object.getPrototypeOf;\nreturn protoOf(protoOf(protoOf(value))) === null;\n```\n\nLodash's `_.isMap()` also supports cross-realm `Map` checks, but it uses a less robust algorithm that can be easily fooled.

This is likely due to the fact that many of Node's standard library functions are implemented in JavaScript itself.\n\nOn [Lodash's website](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNative) you'll also see a warning about how their `_.isNative()` functions are unable to tell the difference between a core.js function and a native one, so if it detects that you are using core.js, their `_.isNative()` will always throw. The above `isNative()` is also unable to tell the difference between a core.js polyfilled function and a native one.\n\nEvery code snippet provided in Snap.js is operating under the assumption that the standard library is pristine and untouched, and the above `isNative()` operates under the same assumption. As long as no one is monkey-patching the standard library, the `isNative()` function will work with any modern JavaScript engine just fine and can't be spoofed. The reason Core.js is capable of getting around these checks is because it monkey-patches `Function.prototype.toString` and replaces it with its own implementation. If you're worried about running in an environment where monkey-patching might be happening, the correct way to handle this (for any of the snap.js functions, and any code you write in general) is to locally cache the built-in functions you need when your code first loads. Then, as long as your library is imported before any monkey-patching happens, your code won't be affected by the monkey-patching at all. If your library loads after monkey patching has happened, then all bets are off - you just have to trust that your host was responsible with how they've been messing with the globals.\n\nHere's an example of how you can make the `isNative()` function in a more robust manner, so that if this module loads before core-js (or any other library that messes with the globals), it'll still work just fine. (Writing robust code as shown above adds a big toll on the readability and maintainability of your codebase - only use techniques like this when it's actually necessary).\n\n```javascript\nconst callBind = fn => fn.call.bind(fn);\n\nconst functionToString = callBind(Function.prototype.toString);\nconst regExpTest = callBind(RegExp.prototype.test);\n\nfunction isNative(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'function') {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const nativeFnPattern = /^function.*?\\(\\) \\{ \\[native code\\] \\}$/;\n  const valueAsString = functionToString(value);\n  return regExpTest(nativeFnPattern, valueAsString);\n}\n```\n\nLodash actually follows this robust code pattern throughout its library, it has just chosen to additionally check for the presence of core.js and throw an error if it found that core.js was loaded, just in case core.js loaded before lodash.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isNil","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isNil(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNil","summary":"Checks if `value` is `null` or `undefined`."},"description":"```javascript\nvalue == null;\n```\n\nIn general, you should never use loose equality (`==`) in JavaScript, however, many people like to make the comparison against `null` an exception to this rule because it's a convenient way to check for either `null` or `undefined` - a fairly common operation.\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to tailor to an audience who may be unfamiliar with the `== null` trick, the following would be the most explicit and easy-to-read way to go.\n\n```javascript\nvalue === null || value === undefined;\n```\n\nThere's also some who like using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to get similar behavior.\n\n```javascript\n(value ?? null) === null;\n```\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isNumber","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isNumber(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNumber","summary":"Checks if `value` is classified as a `Number` primitive or object. **Note:** To exclude `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN`, which are classified as numbers, use the `_.isFinite` method."},"description":"To check if a value is a number primitive:\n\n```javascript\ntypeof value === 'number';\n```\n\nThe above should be good enough for the vast majority of use-cases.\n\nLodash will also check if the value is a number object.

If you need to worry about these kinds of issues, use the following solution instead:\n\n```javascript\n// An isSymbol() check that supports cross-realm Symbol instances.\n// This will check if `value` is a symbol primitive or object.\nfunction isSymbol(value) {\n  try {\n    // If you call this method with a \"this\" value that's anything\n    // other than a boolean primitive or object, a TypeError is thrown.\n    Symbol.prototype.valueOf.call(value);\n    return true;\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error instanceof TypeError) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLodash's `_.isSymbol()` also supports cross-realm `Symbol` object checks, but it uses a less robust algorithm that can be easily fooled. For example, the following will return the wrong answer.\n\n```javascript\n_.isSymbol({ get [Symbol.toStringTag]() { return 'Symbol' } }); // true\n```\n\nIf you're exclusively using Node, you can use `require('util').types.isSymbolObject(value)` to specifically check if the value is a string object (not a primitive).","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isTypedArray","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isTypedArray(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isTypedArray","summary":"Checks if `value` is classified as a typed array."},"description":"All concrete type array classes (like `Int8Array` and `Uint32Array`) inherit from the same abstract superclass `TypedArray`. This superclass isn't directly available on the global object, but it's not too hard to get your hands on it. You can use the `TypedArray` superclass to check if a value is a typed array as follows:\n\n```javascript\nfunction isTypedArray(value) {\n  // Get the super class of all typed arrays.\n  const TypedArray = Object.getPrototypeOf(Int8Array);\n\n  return value instanceof TypedArray;\n}\n\nisTypedArray(new Int8Array()); // true\nisTypedArray(new Uint32Array()); // true\n```\n\nFor the vast majority of scenarios the above should be good enough, but it does technically have a couple of flaws:\n1. they don't work with cross-realm values. For example, if you receive an instance of an `Int8Array` from across an iframe boundary, that instance's prototype would link to the iframe's `TypedArray` class, not your `TypedArray` class, and both of the above checks would fail to recognize it as a typed array.\n2. They will state that `Object.create(TypedArray.prototype)` is a `TypedArray`, but it's not. It's just a regular object who's prototype has been set to `TypedArray.prototype`.\n\nBoth of these issues can be solved with a helper function like this:\n\n```javascript\n// An isTypedArray() check that supports cross-realm typed arrays.\nfunction isTypedArray(value) {\n  const TypedArray = Object.getPrototypeOf(Int8Array);\n  try {\n    // If you call a TypedArray method, like .at(),\n    // with a \"this\" value that's anything\n    // other than a typed array, a TypeError is thrown.\n    TypedArray.prototype.at.call(value, 0);\n    return true;\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error instanceof TypeError) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt's generally considered a bad practice to subclass built-ins, but if you suspect that one of the concrete typed array classes might getting subclassed and handed to you, and you wish to exclude subclasses from your check, you'd also need to walk up the prototype chain. You can modify the above example and replace `return true;` with the following:\n\n```javascript\n// A typed array prototype's chain should be\n// value -> concrete class prototype (like Int8Array.prototype) -> TypedArray.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null\n// If it's not, then we're dealing with a subclass of a concrete typed array.\nconst protoOf = Object.getPrototypeOf;\nreturn protoOf(protoOf(protoOf(protoOf(value)))) === null;\n```\n\nLodash's `_.isTypedArray()` also supports cross-realm typed array checks, but it uses a less robust algorithm that can be easily fooled. For example, if you run Lodash in the browser, the following will return the wrong answer.\n\n```javascript\n_.isTypedArray({ length: 0, get [Symbol.toStringTag]() { return 'Uint8Array' } }); // true\n```\n\nIn Node, Lodash will instead use `require('util').types.isTypedArray(value)` for it's implementation, which you are also welcome to use if you know your code will only run in Node.

Or would an alternative, less-error-prone solution work instead? There are valid reasons to need a function like `_.escape()`, but there are also some coding styles that force you to use it much more often than necessary. For example, perhaps you like to build your webpages via string interpolation and `.innerHTML`, such as in the following:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.body.innerHTML = `<p>${_.escape(userSuppliedString)}</p>`;\n```\n\nThis has the appearance of being simple and concise, but managing when and how to use `_.escape()` can be error-prone. There are a number of alternative solutions out there that remove many of these pitfalls (but not all, so you still need to look out for XSS vunerabilities no matter how you code). For example, you can use the browser APIs to manually build up your HTML instead of using string manipulation + `.innerHTML`.\n\n```javascript\nconst paragraph = document.createElement('p');\n// .innerText will automatically escape HTML characters for you.\nparagraph.innerText = userSuppliedString;\ndocument.body.replaceWith(paragraph);\n```\n\nIf you find this APIs to be cumbersome to use, you may enjoy [a little helper function](#!/utils/el) to make using it more tolerable.\n\nOr you can define your HTML [in template tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots) (The linked guied will additionally show you how to use tamplate tags in conjunction with custom HTML elements).\n\nOr maybe you really like the looks of building up your HTML as strings, in which case you might consider using a third-party templating system such as [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/).\n\nAll of these options will provide ways to auto-escape user-input for you, allowing you to focus more on UI building and less on data sanitization.\n\n","src":null,"test":"function escapeHtmlChars(string) {\n  return string\n    .replaceAll('&', '&amp;')\n    .replaceAll('<', '&lt;')\n    .replaceAll('>', '&gt;')\n    .replaceAll('\"', '&quot;')\n    .replaceAll(\"'\", '&#39;');\n}\n\ndescribe('escapeHtmlChars()', () => {\n  it('escapes all characters', () => {\n    const res = escapeHtmlChars('&<>\"\\'');\n    expect(res).toEqual('&amp;&lt;&gt;&quot;&#39;');\n  });\n\n  it('escapes all instances', () => {\n    const res = escapeHtmlChars('&<&<&');\n    expect(res).toEqual('&amp;&lt;&amp;&lt;&amp;');\n  });\n\n  it(\"doesn't panic on the empty string\", () => {\n    expect(escapeHtmlChars('')).toEqual('');\n  });\n});\n"},{"name":"unescape","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.unescape(string)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#unescape","summary":"The inverse of _.escape; this method converts the HTML entities &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, and &#39; in string to their corresponding characters."},"description":"If you wish to unescape all HTML-encoded characters and you're in a browser environment, you can use the following:\n\n```javascript\nfunction unescapeHtmlChars(string) {\n  const doc = new DOMParser().parseFromString(input, 'text/html');\n  return doc.documentElement.textContent;\n}\n```\n\nIf your JavaScript is not running in a browser, you can instead use a library such as [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) to mimic the DOM and provide the same kind of API, or you can use a lighter-weight package that only provides this HTML-character-unescaping functionality and nothing else, such as [html-entities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-entities).\n\nLodash's `_.unescape()` function does not unescape all HTML characters, only those that get escaped when using `_.escape()`, which means using its implementation would be insufficient in most situations. Nevertheless, if you are wanting an implementation like Lodash's, you can use the following:\n\n```javascript\nfunction unescapeHtmlChars(string) {\n  // Unecoding \"&\" needs to be done last.\n  // If it is done first, something like \"&amp;lt;\" would incorrectly\n  // get unencoded to \"<\", when it should be \"&lt;\"\n  return string\n    .replaceAll('&lt;', '<')\n    .replaceAll('&gt;', '>')\n    .replaceAll('&quot;', '\"')\n    .replaceAll('&#39;', \"'\")\n    .replaceAll('&amp;', '&');\n}\n```\n\n## Don't use unescapeHtmlChars() unless you have to\n\nThe use of `unescapeHtmlChars()` may (or may not) indicate an issue with how you're storing and transfering data. Escaping HTML characters is an operation that is generally done the moment before you insert it into your page. If this pattern is followed, you will generally have an unescaped version of your string on-hand as well, which removes the need for using an `unescapeHtmlChars()` function.
