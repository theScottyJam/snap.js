You can do it, but without the help of a third-party library, you'll just be fighting against the language and its uncurried standard library every step of the way. If you want to do point-free programming, you are better off adopting a library such as Rambda, which basically provides an alternative, pre-curried standard library along with some helper functions such as a replacement for Lodash's `_.curryRight()`.\n\nThat being said, you can easily curry-right any function by using arrow function syntax. For example, to curry-right a function that takes two arguments, do the following:\n\n```javascript\n// hasOwn() is a curried-right version of Object.hasOwn()\nconst hasOwn = prop => obj => Object.hasOwn(obj, prop);\n\n// Example usage:\nconst doesObjHaveMyProp = hasOwn('exampleProp');\nconsole.log(doesObjHaveMyProp({ exampleProp: 22 })); // true\n```\n\nIf you want a function that does it, you can use the following:\n\n```javascript\nfunction curryRight(func, arity, _appliedArgs = []) {\n  return (...args) => {\n    const newAppliedArgs = [...args, ..._appliedArgs];\n    if (newAppliedArgs.length < arity) {\n      return curryRight(func, arity, newAppliedArgs);\n    } else {\n      return func(...newAppliedArgs);\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAnd if you need support for being able to skip parameters when partially applying a curried function (i.e. passing in the `_` value when calling it), you can use the following:\n\n```javascript\nconst _ = Symbol('curry placeholder');\n\nfunction curryRight(func, arity, _appliedArgs = {}, _numApplied = 0) {\n  return (...args) => {\n    const appliedArgs = { ..._appliedArgs };\n    let numApplied = _numApplied;\n    for (let i = arity - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n      if (i in appliedArgs) continue;\n      if (args.at(-1) !== _) {\n        numApplied++;\n        appliedArgs[i] = args.at(-1);\n      }\n      args.pop();\n      if (args.length === 0) break;\n    }\n\n    if (numApplied === arity) {\n      return func(...Array.from({ ...appliedArgs, length: arity }));\n    } else {\n      return curryRight(func, arity, appliedArgs, numApplied);\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\nNotice that the `curryRight()` functions above requires you to supply an `arity` parameter - it does not fall back to using `func.length` (i.e. the number of parameters `func` says it takes). This is purposely different from Lodash's `_.curryRight()`. Code maintainers often don't consider the `length` property of their functions to be a value they're supposed to keep stable between releases - in fact, many JavaScript developers are not even be aware of its existence.

You can do it, but without the help of a third-party library, you'll just be fighting against the language and its uncurried standard library every step of the way. If you want to do point-free programming, you are better off adopting a library such as Rambda, which basically provides an alternative, pre-curried standard library along with some helper functions such as a replacement for Lodash's `_.curry()`.\n\nThat being said, you can easily curry any function by using arrow function syntax. For example, to curry a function that takes two arguments, do the following:\n\n```javascript\n// hasOwn() is a curried version of Object.hasOwn()\nconst hasOwn = obj => prop => Object.hasOwn(obj, prop);\n\n// Example usage:\nconst doesMyObjHaveProp = hasOwn({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nconsole.log(doesMyObjHaveProp('a')); // true\n```\n\nIf you want a function that does it, you can use the following:\n\n```javascript\nfunction curry(func, arity, _appliedArgs = []) {\n  return (...args) => {\n    const newAppliedArgs = [..._appliedArgs, ...args];\n    if (newAppliedArgs.length < arity) {\n      return curry(func, arity, newAppliedArgs)\n    } else {\n      return func(...newAppliedArgs);\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAnd if you need support for being able to skip parameters when partially applying a curried function (i.e. passing in the `_` value when calling it), you can use the following:\n\n```javascript\nconst _ = Symbol('curry placeholder');\n\nfunction curry(func, arity, _appliedArgs = {}, _numApplied = 0) {\n  return (...args) => {\n    const appliedArgs = { ..._appliedArgs };\n    let numApplied = _numApplied;\n    for (let i = 0; i < arity; i++) {\n      if (i in appliedArgs) continue;\n      if (args[0] !== _) {\n        numApplied++;\n        appliedArgs[i] = args[0];\n      }\n      args.shift();\n      if (args.length === 0) break;\n    }\n\n    if (numApplied === arity) {\n      return func(...Array.from({ ...appliedArgs, length: arity }));\n    } else {\n      return curry(func, arity, appliedArgs, numApplied);\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\nNotice that the `curry()` functions above requires you to supply an `arity` parameter - it does not fall back to using `func.length` (i.e. the number of parameters `func` says it takes). This is purposely different from Lodash's `_.curry()`. Code maintainers often don't consider the `length` property of their functions to be a value they're supposed to keep stable between releases - in fact, many JavaScript developers are not even be aware of its existence. People are generally free to do updates such as `(x, y) => { ... }` to `(...args) => { ... }` or `(x, y) => { if (y === undefined) { y = someDefault; } ... }` to `(x, y=someDefault) => { ... }`.

You can modify the above example and replace `return true;` with the following:\n\n```javascript\n// A ArrayBuffer's prototype's chain should be\n// value -> ArrayBuffer.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null\n// If it's not, then we're dealing with an ArrayBuffer subclass.\nconst protoOf = Object.getPrototypeOf;\nreturn protoOf(protoOf(protoOf(value))) === null;\n```\n\nLodash's `_.isArrayBuffer()` also supports cross-realm ArrayBuffer checks, but it uses a less robust algorithm that can be easily fooled.

Note that this version does not support circular references - if you need to support that, you'll additionally need to keep around a set containing each value you've visited to make sure you're not going in a loop.\n\n```javascript\nconst isPrimitive = value => value !== Object(value);\n\nconst isPlainObject = value => (\n  value != null &&\n  [null, Object.prototype].includes(Object.getPrototypeOf(value))\n);\n\nfunction isEqualWith(value1, value2, customizer, _parentNodeInfo = undefined) {\n  // Each type corresponds to a particular comparison algorithm\n  const getType = value => {\n    if (isPrimitive(value)) return 'primitive';\n    if (Array.isArray(value)) return 'array';\n    if (isPlainObject(value)) return 'plainObject';\n    throw new Error(`deeply comparing an instance of type ${value1.constructor?.name} is not supported.`);\n  };\n\n  // Checks with the customizer() function to see if it\n  // wants to override the default comparison behavior\n  {\n    let customizerResult;\n    if (_parentNodeInfo === undefined) {\n      customizerResult = customizer(value1, value2);\n    } else {\n      const { key, value1Parent, value2Parent } = _parentNodeInfo;\n      customizerResult = customizer(value1, value2, key, value1Parent, value2Parent);\n    }\n\n    if (customizerResult !== undefined) {\n      return customizerResult;\n    }\n  }\n\n  const type = getType(value1);\n  if (type !== getType(value2)) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  if (type === 'primitive') {\n    return (\n      value1 === value2 ||\n      (Number.isNaN(value1) && Number.isNaN(value2))\n    );\n  } else if (type === 'array') {\n    return (\n      value1.length === value2.length &&\n      value1.every(\n        (iterValue, i) => isEqualWith(\n          iterValue,\n          value2[i],\n          customizer,\n          { value1Parent: value1, value2Parent: value2, key: i }\n        )\n      )\n    );\n  } else if (type === 'plainObject') {\n    const value1AsMap = new Map(Object.entries(value1));\n    const value2AsMap = new Map(Object.entries(value2));\n    return (\n      value1AsMap.size === value2AsMap.size &&\n      [...value1AsMap].every(([iterKey, iterValue]) => {\n        return (\n          value2AsMap.has(iterKey) &&\n          isEqualWith(\n            iterValue,\n            value2AsMap.get(iterKey),\n            customizer,\n            { value1Parent: value1, value2Parent: value2, key: iterKey }\n          )\n        );\n      })\n    );\n  } else {\n    throw new Error('Unreachable');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn Lodash, the customizer function would be called with a sixth \"stack\" argument. Some probing shows that it's an instance of an internal \"Stack\" class that provides some methods which, presumably, can be used to gather information about the objects you're comparing. Due to the fact that this seems to be a rather complex feature that's entirely undocumented, it'll be assumed that the vast majority of users do not use this parameter, and so it's functionality won't be recreated here either.\n\nSpecial data types, like Maps and Sets, are not supported in the above example. This is partly because Lodash chooses to support them in a slightly odd way that you may not wish to mirror. For example:\n* The fourth or fifth argument to your customizer function is supposed to be the parent node, but if that parent node was a `Map` or `Set` instance, you'll instead receive arrays containing the node's contents (e.g. a map of usernames to ids would be turned into `[['Sally', 1], ['Zack', 2]]` before being provided to you).\n* When comparing two sets, like `new Set([1, 2, 3, 4])` and `new Set([5, 6, 7, 8])`, its going to call your `customizer` function _16_ different times (assuming the `customizer` function returns `false` or `undefined` each time). As your sets grow in length, the amount of times it has to call your customizer grows exponentially. Maps have a similar issue. This behavior is required to implement the general-purpose algorithm Lodash was going for, but maybe for your use-case you don't need your algorithm to be so general-purpose - maybe you can cut some corners to help with performance.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isError","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isError(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isError","summary":"Checks if value is an `Error`, `EvalError`, `RangeError`, `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, or `URIError` object."},"description":"Lodash's documentation makes it sound like they're checking if the value is specifically an instance of a set of built-in errors, but in reality, they're considering any [non-plain object](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isPlainObject) that has `message` and `name` properties that are strings to be errors. So, the following would return `true` despite not being an error.\n\n```javascript\nclass NotAnError {\n  name = 'NotAnError';\n  message = 'this is not an error';\n}\n\n_.isError(new NotAnError()); // true\n```\n\nIf you actually want to check if a value is an error or one of its subclasses (like `TypeError`, or a user-defined subclass), you can simply do this:\n\n```javascript\nvalue instanceof Error;\n```\n\nAnd if you want to check if a value is a specific error type (like `Error`, `TypeError`, or a user defined error), and you want to exclude subclasses, you can compare prototypes like this:\n\n```javascript\n// Replace `TypeError` with the Error class of your choice.\nObject.getPrototypeOf(value) === TypeError.prototype;\n```\n\nFor the vast majority of scenarios the above should be good enough, but those solutions do technically have a couple of flaws:\n1. they don't work with cross-realm values. For example, if you receive an instance of an `Error` from across an iframe boundary, that instance's prototype would link to the iframe's `Error` class, not your `Error` class, and both of the above checks would fail to recognize it as a `Error`.\n2. They will state that `Object.create(Error.prototype)` is an `Error`, but it's not. It's just a regular object who's prototype has been set to `Error.prototype`.\n\nBoth of these issues can be solved with a helper function like this:\n\n```javascript\n// An isError() check that supports cross-realm Errors.\nfunction isError(value) {\n  // DOMException and its subclasses will set a `Symbol.toStringTag` property\n  // on their instances to the string 'DOMException'.\n  const errorAsString = Object.prototype.toString.call(value);\n  return ['[object Error]', '[object DOMException]'].includes(errorAsString);\n}\n```\n\nThis helper function can unfortunately be spoofed by providing any object with a `Symbol.toStringTag` property set to one of the expected string tags, like this:\n\n```javascript\nisError({ [Symbol.toStringTag]: 'DOMException' }); // true\n```\n\nThere's not really anything that can be done to avoid this.

This is likely due to the fact that many of Node's standard library functions are implemented in JavaScript itself.\n\nOn [Lodash's website](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNative) you'll also see a warning about how their `_.isNative()` functions are unable to tell the difference between a core.js function and a native one, so if it detects that you are using core.js, their `_.isNative()` will always throw. The above `isNative()` is also unable to tell the difference between a core.js polyfilled function and a native one.\n\nEvery code snippet provided in Snap.js is operating under the assumption that the standard library is pristine and untouched, and the above `isNative()` operates under the same assumption. As long as no one is monkey-patching the standard library, the `isNative()` function will work with any modern JavaScript engine just fine and can't be spoofed. The reason Core.js is capable of getting around these checks is because it monkey-patches `Function.prototype.toString` and replaces it with its own implementation. If you're worried about running in an environment where monkey-patching might be happening, the correct way to handle this (for any of the snap.js functions, and any code you write in general) is to locally cache the built-in functions you need when your code first loads. Then, as long as your library is imported before any monkey-patching happens, your code won't be affected by the monkey-patching at all. If your library loads after monkey patching has happened, then all bets are off - you just have to trust that your host was responsible with how they've been messing with the globals.\n\nHere's an example of how you can make the `isNative()` function in a more robust manner, so that if this module loads before core-js (or any other library that messes with the globals), it'll still work just fine. (Writing robust code as shown above adds a big toll on the readability and maintainability of your codebase - only use techniques like this when it's actually necessary).\n\n```javascript\nconst callBind = fn => fn.call.bind(fn);\n\nconst functionToString = callBind(Function.prototype.toString);\nconst regExpTest = callBind(RegExp.prototype.test);\n\nfunction isNative(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'function') {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const nativeFnPattern = /^function.*?\\(\\) \\{ \\[native code\\] \\}$/;\n  const valueAsString = functionToString(value);\n  return regExpTest(nativeFnPattern, valueAsString);\n}\n```\n\nLodash actually follows this robust code pattern throughout its library, it has just chosen to additionally check for the presence of core.js and throw an error if it found that core.js was loaded, just in case core.js loaded before lodash.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isNil","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isNil(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNil","summary":"Checks if `value` is `null` or `undefined`."},"description":"```javascript\nvalue == null;\n```\n\nIn general, you should never use loose equality (`==`) in JavaScript, however, many people like to make the comparison against `null` an exception to this rule because it's a convenient way to check for either `null` or `undefined` - a fairly common operation.\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to tailor to an audience who may be unfamiliar with the `== null` trick, the following would be the most explicit and easy-to-read way to go.\n\n```javascript\nvalue === null || value === undefined;\n```\n\nThere's also some who like using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to get similar behavior.\n\n```javascript\n(value ?? null) === null;\n```\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isNull","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isNull(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNull","summary":"Checks if `value` is `null`."},"description":"```javascript\nvalue === null\n```\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isNumber","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isNumber(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNumber","summary":"Checks if `value` is classified as a `Number` primitive or object. **Note:** To exclude `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN`, which are classified as numbers, use the `_.isFinite` method."},"description":"To check if a value is a number primitive:\n\n```javascript\ntypeof value === 'number';\n```\n\nThe above should be good enough for the vast majority of use-cases.\n\nLodash will also check if the value is a number object. In practice, such objects should never be found in your codebase, and if someone ever tries to hand such an object to you you really ought to treat it the same way you would treat any other bad input (throw an error, or if you aren't explicitly trying to check for bad inputs just let your library fall over, the same way it would with any other bad input).\n\nTo check if something is specifically a number object (and not a primitive), use the following:\n\n```javascript\nvalue instanceof Number;\n```\n\nThis, however, doesn't work cross realm (i.e. a number object created from inside an iframe would fail this check).

The ability to globally overwrite the `undefined` value was changed in ES5, removing this concern in modern browsers. Even back then, this concern was largely over-hyped - yes you can override the value of `undefined`, but you can also override `Array`, `Math`, `Object`, `Function`, `setTimeout`, and so on - if the code you write doesn't try to defend against these globals being overwritten, then it should not try to defend against `undefined` being overwritten either.\n\nSide rant: In case you didn't know, `void` is _not_ a function, it is a prefix operator with the same precedence as `!`, `await`, `typeof`, and so on. You don't try to pretend `await` is a function by always adding parentheses after it, do you? (`await(doSomeAsyncTask())`)? No. And you really don't need to do it with `void` either. Is there harm in pretending a prefix operator is a function? In general, yes, because it makes order of operations confusing - if we pretend that `await` is a function, then you might end up writing code such as `await(getUser(id)).username` that looks reasonable, except it's not going to work - `getUser(...)` is going to return a promise, and then it's going to try to access the `username` property on that promise _before_ the `await` happens, which is not what the author intended. Is it bad to pretend that `void`, specifically, is a function instead of an operator. Well, technically no, there's no reasonable code that you would write using `void` where order of operations would get confusing, at least in the language as it stands today.

These can be used to convert a variety of different values, including bigint, booleans, strings, etc.\n\nIf you are converting a string to a number, you will likely want to additionally compare your string against a regular expression to make sure it is in the format you expect it to be in. The following are some strings that `Number()` will happily parse for you, that you might want to prevent with your regular expression:\n* Strings containing numbers with leading and/or trailing spaces (e.g. `Number('  23  ') === 23`)\n* Decimal number (e.g. `Number('2.3') === 2.3` or `Number('2.3E+5') === 2.3E+5`)\n* Scientific notation (e.g. `Number('2e3') === 2e3`)\n* Numbers in different basis (e.g. `Number('0x2a') === 0x2a`, `Number('0o47') === 0o47`, or `Number('0b101') === 0b101`)\n* Empty strings and white-space-only strings (e.g. `Number(' \\t \\n ') === 0`)\n* Numbers with a sign (e.g. `Number('-2') === -2` or `Number('+2') === +2`)\n* Infinity and -Infinity? (e.g. `Number('-Infinity') === -Infinity`)\n* Leading zeros? (e.g. `Number('012') === 12`)\n\nAs a concrete example, if you are receiving user input, and you only want to allow integer inputs (and you are ok with leading zeros), you can use a function like the following to get your desired behavior:\n\n```javascript\nfunction parseUserInput(value) {\n  // Ensures the string only contains digits and nothing else.\n  if (!value.match(/^\\d+$/)) {\n    throw new Error('Invalid user input');\n  }\n\n  const parsedValue = Number(value);\n\n  if (Number.isNaN(parsedValue)) {\n    throw new Error('Invalid user input');\n  }\n\n  return parsedValue;\n}\n```\n\n## What about parseInt() and parseFloat()?\n\nYou are welcome to use either of these functions as well for string-to-number conversions. These two functions follow their own different algorithms for parsing numbers that may or may not align with what you need. One unfortunate design decision to be aware of with these functions is the fact that as soon as they come across an invalid character, instead of returning an error value (`NaN`), they just parse what they can and return a number. This means, for example, `parseInt('2e7')` will unintuitively return the number `2`, because it doesn't know how to parse the `e`. All this really means is that it is even more important to use some up-front checking with a regular expression to ensure your string is formatted the way you would expect before handing the string off to `parseInt()` or `parseFloat()` to parse. It is also for this reason that I prefer using `Number()` over `parseInt()`/`parseFloat()` - `Number()` is less likely to surprise you with an unexpected result.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"toSafeInteger","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.toSafeInteger(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#toSafeInteger","summary":"Converts `value` to a safe integer.

This can be handled by removing `undefined`/`null` from `object` before applying default values, as follows:\n\n```javascript\n// The behavior of this function can easily be tweaked if, for example,\n// you also wish to remove `null` fields from an object.\nfunction removeUndefinedProps(object) {\n  const filteredEntries = Object.entries(object)\n    .filter(([key, value]) => value !== undefined);\n\n  return Object.fromEntries(filteredEntries);\n}\n\nconst result = {\n  ...defaults,\n  ...removeUndefinedProps(object),\n  subObj: {\n    ...subObjDefaults,\n    ...removeUndefinedProps(object.subObj ?? {}),\n  },\n};\n```\n\nFinally, if you don't feel any of these patterns will fit your use-case very well, you can use the following helper function, which mimics `_.defaultsDeep()`.\n\n```javascript\nconst isObject = value => ['object', 'function'].includes(typeof value) && value !== null;\n\n// NOTE: This mutates `object`.\nfunction defaultsDeep(object, ...sources) {\n  for (const source of sources) {\n    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(source)) {\n      if (object[key] === undefined) {\n        object[key] = value;\n      } else if (isObject(value) && isObject(source[key])) {\n        defaultsDeep(object[key], value);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return object;\n}\n```\n\nNote that the Lodash implementation would pick both own and inherited properties from the default objects, while this third pattern of spreading objects does not. In practice, this shouldn't matter much because 1. Generally, your default objects won't have inherited fields, and 2. Even if they did, if those inherited fields are set up \"properly\" (i.e. the same way the class syntax automatically does for you), they should also be non-enumerable, and Lodash's `_.defaultsDeep()` does not pick non-enumerable fields from the defaults object.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"findKey","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.findKey(object, predicate?)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#findKey","summary":"This method is like `_.find` except that it returns the key of the first element predicate returns truthy for instead of the element itself."},"description":"```javascript\nObject.entries(object)\n  .find(([key, value]) => predicate(value))?.[0];\n```\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"findLastKey","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.findLastKey(object, predicate?)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#findLastKey","summary":"This method is like `_.findKey` except that it iterates over elements of a collection in the opposite order."},"description":"```javascript\nObject.entries(object)\n  .findLast(([key, value]) => predicate(value))?.[0];\n```\n\nPlease don't actually use this solution.\n\nObjects are supposed to be treated as unordered collections.

A circled C (\"Ⓒ\") would likewise be normalized into a \"C\", however, the copyright symbol (\"©\") (which is a different code point from a circled C) will not be normalized into a \"C\", because, conceptually, the copyright symbol isn't intended to simply be a variation on the character \"C\".\n\nDepending on your use-case, you may find the NFD \"Canonical Decomposition\" algorithm to be a more appropriate choice. This algorithm will only normalize characters that are literally the same but have multiple representations. For example, the \"ñ\" character is a single code point while the \"ñ\" character is an \"n\" followed by a tilde modifier - since these are just two different ways to represent the exact same character, they'll be normalized by the \"Canonical Decomposition\" algorithm into the decomposed variant - the \"n\" followed by a tilde modifier.\n\n[Learn more about normalization algorithms, including other available algorithms on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize).\n\nThe above `deburr()` implementation isn't exactly the same as Lodash's.

The mapping function receives, as the second argument, the current item number geing generated.\n\nHere's another way to accomplishing the same thing in a slightly different style:\n\n```javascript\n// Same as _.range(4, 10, 2)\n// And the same as Array.from({ length: 3 }, (_, i) => 4 + i*2) // => [4, 6, 8]\nnew Array(3).fill().map((_, i) => 4 + i*2) // => [4, 6, 8]\n```\n\n`new Array(n)` creates array holes, which are an emptiness state that is different from `undefined` and `null`, that have an inconsistent iteration behavior - some array methods treat holes like `undefined` and others will skip over them entirely. Because of this, it is generally advisable to avoid array holes and `new Array(n)`. The use of `.fill()` right after `new Array(n)` will cause the array holes to immediately be plugged with `undefined`, fixing the problem. If you want to be strict about avoiding array holes, then you may want to avoid this solution, preferring to instead use the `Array.from()` solution. Alternatively, you may see `new Array(n).fill()` as an acceptable exception to the \"avoid array holes\" guidelines and be ok with this solution.\n\nYou can also use the following if you want a more complete helper function that does the math for you. Feel free to remove any pieces of this function that you don't currently need.\n\n```javascript\nfunction range(...args) {\n  // Adds support for passing in a single argument.\n  if (args.length === 1) {\n    const end = args[0];\n    return range(0, end);\n  }\n  const [start, end, step = 1] = args;\n\n  // A couple of checks to prevent accidental infinite loops.\n  // Number.isFinite() is making sure the values are numbers, and they aren't NaN or Infinity.\n  if (step === 0 || ![start, end, step].every(n => Number.isFinite(n))) {\n    throw new Error('Received an invalid argument.');\n  }\n\n  const result = [];\n  if (step > 0) {\n    for (let i = start; i < end; i += step) {\n      result.push(i);\n    }\n  } else {\n    for (let i = start; i > end; i += step) {\n      result.push(i);\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation isn't exactly the same as Lodash's in that if you call `range()` with a single, negative argument, Lodash will produce a range that counts down to it. To keep things a little simpler, the above implementation won't automatically swap to a step of -1, and will instead return the empty array.\n\nThere is [an upcoming \"iterator range\" proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator.range) that will introduce a native range function.\n","src":null,"test":"function range(...args) {\n  // Adds support for passing in a single argument.\n  if (args.length === 1) {\n    const end = args[0];\n    return range(0, end);\n  }\n  const [start, end, step = 1] = args;\n\n  // A couple of checks to prevent accidental infinite loops.\n  // Number.isFinite() is making sure the values are numbers, and they aren't NaN or Infinity.\n  if (step === 0 || ![start, end, step].every(n => Number.isFinite(n))) {\n    throw new Error('Received an invalid argument.');\n  }\n\n  const result = [];\n  if (step > 0) {\n    for (let i = start; i < end; i += step) {\n      result.push(i);\n    }\n  } else {\n    for (let i = start; i > end; i += step) {\n      result.push(i);\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n\ndescribe('range()', () => {\n  it('treats a single argument as the stop argument', () => {\n    expect(range(5)).toEqual([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);\n  });\n\n  it('accepts floats as a single argument', () => {\n    expect(range(4.5)).toEqual([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);\n  });\n\n  it('returns an empty array when given a non-positive single argument', () => {\n    expect(range(0)).toEqual([]);\n    expect(range(-5)).toEqual([]);\n  });\n\n  it('can accept a start and stop argument', () => {\n    expect(range(2, 5)).toEqual([2, 3, 4]);\n  });\n\n  it('can accept a start, stop, and step argument', () => {\n    expect(range(4, 10, 2)).toEqual([4, 6, 8]);\n  });\n\n  it('can iterate backwards', () => {\n    expect(range(5, 2, -1)).toEqual([5, 4, 3]);\n  });\n\n  it('can iterate over floats', () => {\n    expect(range(3, 5, 0.5)).toEqual([3, 3.5, 4, 4.5]);\n  });\n\n  it('return an empty array if the step is pointed in the wrong direction', () => {\n    expect(range(2, 4, -1)).toEqual([]);\n    expect(range(4, 2)).toEqual([]);\n  });\n\n  it('return an empty array if the stop is already at the start', () => {\n    expect(range(4, 4)).toEqual([]);\n    expect(range(4, 4, -1)).toEqual([]);\n  });\n\n  it('throws when any of the arguments are not a finite number', () => {\n    expect(() => range(-Infinity)).toThrow('invalid argument');\n    expect(() => range(NaN)).toThrow('invalid argument');\n    expect(() => range('23')).toThrow('invalid argument');\n\n    expect(() => range(Infinity, 5, 2)).toThrow('invalid argument');\n    expect(() => range(2, NaN, 3)).toThrow('invalid argument');\n    expect(() => range(1, 2, '23')).toThrow('invalid argument');\n  });\n});\n"},{"name":"rangeRight","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.rangeRight(start?, end, step?)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#rangeRight","summary":"This method is like `_.range` except that it populates values in descending order."},"description":"Refer to [the _.range() documentation entry](#!/nolodash/range) for various techniques on producing a range of values.

The mapping function receives, as the second argument, the current item number geing generated.\n\nHere's another way to accomplishing the same thing in a slightly different style:\n\n```javascript\nnew Array(n).fill().map((_, i) => iteratee(i)) // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n`new Array(n)` creates array holes, which are an emptiness state that is different from `undefined` and `null`, that have an inconsistent iteration behavior - some array methods treat holes like `undefined` and others will skip over them entirely. Because of this, it is generally advisable to avoid array holes and `new Array(n)`. The use of `.fill()` right after `new Array(n)` will cause the array holes to immediately be plugged with `undefined`, fixing the problem. If you want to be strict about avoiding array holes, then you may want to avoid this solution, preferring to instead use the `Array.from()` solution.
