If you're a library developer who may be receiving arbitrary user input, simply treat arguments that could potentially be sparse arrays the same way you would treat any other kind of bad input the end-user gives you. If you don't do any data validation, then don't worry about it - a sparse array would result in undefined behavior, the same way any other bad input would.

In Lodash's version, if you provide a falsey value, `undefined` will be returned. In JavaScript, if you try to spread a falsey value into `Math.max()`, you'll get a runtime error, because falsey values aren't iterable. In practice, this difference shouldn't matter much - you should know the types of values you're trying to use, and if you suspect that it might be falsey, just check for that before calling `Math.max()`, instead of checking if the result is undefined after calling `_.max()`.\n\n2. In Lodash's version, if you provide an empty array, `undefined` is returned. In JavaScript, if you spread an empty array, or you provide no arguments, `-Infinity` is returned. JavaScript's `-Infinity`, while, at first, may sound odd, can actually be a useful return value.

Even if you achieve inheritance other ways (by manually messing with the prototypes), it can be argued that it's more proper to make the methods on the prototype non-enumerable.\n2. It's long been considered a good practice whenever using a for-in loop, to also check if the property you're iterating over is non-inherited, by nesting an `if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, key)) { ... }` check into your loop. This was done, among other reasons, to guard against the case where someone may have improperly mutated `Object.prototype`, and added an enumerable property to it. This `for-in` + `is-own` check isn't seen as much in the wild anymore, because the language has since come out with a better way to inherit over non-inherited keys, which is discussed in the `_.forOwn()` entry.\n\nIf you just want to iterate over object keys, and don't want to worry about inherited properties or the ordering of keys, look at `_.forOwn()` instead.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"forOwn","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.forOwn(object, iteratee?)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#forOwn","summary":"Iterates over own enumerable string keyed properties of an object and invokes `iteratee` for each property.

They don't provide any tools to modify the ordering of an object (like, \"move this property, so that it's second in iteration order, instead of last\"), and the lack of these types of tools exist for a reason - they don't _want_ you to write code that relies on the order, nor does anyone trying to read and understand your code.
