If you don't do any data validation, then don't worry about it - a sparse array would result in undefined behavior, the same way any other bad input would.

asynchronous tasks have finished, as shown in this example from their documentation.\n\n```javascript\nvar saves = ['profile', 'settings'];\n \nvar done = _.after(saves.length, function() {\n  console.log('done saving!');\n});\n \n_.forEach(saves, function(type) {\n  asyncSave({ 'type': type, 'complete': done });\n});\n// => Logs 'done saving!' after the two async saves have completed.\n```\n\nNow days, the `asyncSave()` function from the example would typically be written to return a promise instead of accepting a callback (and if its not, you can convert it to a promise-based function yourself with the [Promise constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise)). With a promise-based `asyncSave()`, we can rewrite this example to just use `Promise.all()` instead.\n\n```javascript\nawait Promise.all([\n  asyncSave({ type: 'profile' }),\n  asyncSave({ type: 'settings' }),\n])\n\nconsole.log('done saving!');\n// => Logs 'done saving!' after the two async saves have completed.\n```\n\nIf the `saves` array is dynamically generated, you can use the [`Promise.all()` + `array.map()` pattern](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37576787/7696223).\n\n```javascript\nconst saves = getAnArrayFromSomewhere();\n \nawait Promise.all(saves.map(async type => {\n  await asyncSave({ type });\n}))\n\nconsole.log('done saving!');\n// => Logs 'done saving!' after the two async saves have completed.\n```\n\nThat being said, if you need a utility that acts like Lodash's `_.after()`, here's how you could code it up:\n\n```javascript\nfunction after(n, func) {\n  let callCount = 0;\n  return function(...args) {\n    callCount++;\n    if (callCount < n) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // Using .call() may be overkill.\n    // You could just do `return func(...args)` if you\n    // don't need to worry about preserving the \"this\" argument.\n    return func.call(this, ...args);\n  };\n}\n```\n","src":null,"test":"function after(n, func) {\n  let callCount = 0;\n  return function (...args) {\n    callCount++;\n    if (callCount < n) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // Using .call() may be overkill.\n    // You could just do `return func(...args)` if you\n    // don't need to worry about preserving the \"this\" argument.\n    return func.call(this, ...args);\n  };\n}\n\ndescribe('after()', () => {\n  it('calls the passed-in callback as normal once returned function has been called n times', () => {\n    const fn = after(3, (x, y) => x + y);\n\n    expect(fn(2, 3)).toEqual(undefined);\n    expect(fn(2, 3)).toEqual(undefined);\n    expect(fn(2, 3)).toEqual(5);\n  });\n\n  it('preserves the \"this\" argument', () => {\n    let self;\n\n    const fn = after(1, function () {\n      self = this;\n    });\n\n    const myThis = { x: 2 };\n    fn.call(myThis);\n\n    expect(self).toEqual(myThis);\n  });\n});\n"},{"name":"ary","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.ary(func, n)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#ary","summary":"Creates a function that invokes `func`, with up to `n` arguments, ignoring any additional arguments."},"description":"`_.ary()` was created before JavaScript provided arrow function syntax.

You can do it, but without the help of a third-party library, you'll just be fighting against the language and its uncurried standard library every step of the way. If you want to do point-free programming, you are better off adopting a library such as Rambda, which basically provides an alternative, pre-curried standard library along with some helper functions such as a replacement for Lodash's `_.curry()`.\n\nThat being said, if you really want a basic implementation for a curry function, you can use the following:\n\n```javascript\nfunction curry(func, arity, _appliedArgs = []) {\n  return (...args) => {\n    const newAppliedArgs = [..._appliedArgs, ...args];\n    if (newAppliedArgs.length < arity) {\n      return curry(func, arity, newAppliedArgs)\n    } else {\n      return func(...newAppliedArgs);\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAnd if you need support for being able to skip parameters when partially applying a curried function (i.e. passing in the `_` value when calling it), you can use the following:\n\n```javascript\nconst _ = Symbol('curry placeholder');\n\nfunction curry(func, arity, _appliedArgs = {}) {\n  return (...args) => {\n    const appliedArgs = { ..._appliedArgs };\n    for (let i = 0; i < arity; i++) {\n      if (i in appliedArgs) continue;\n      if (args[0] !== _) {\n        appliedArgs[i] = args[0];\n      }\n      args.shift();\n      if (args.length === 0) break;\n    }\n\n    if ((arity - 1) in appliedArgs || arity === 0) {\n      return func(...Array.from({ ...appliedArgs, length: arity }));\n    } else {\n      return curry(func, arity, appliedArgs)\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\nNotice that the `curry()` function above does not fall back to setting the `arity` parameter to `func.length` (i.e. the number of parameters `func` says it takes), instead, you're required to pass it in. This is purposely different from Lodash's `_.curry()`. Code maintainers often don't consider the `length` property of their functions to be a value they're supposed to keep stable between releases - in fact, many JavaScript developers are not even be aware of its existence.

For example, if you receive an instance of an `ArrayBuffer` from across an iframe boundary, that instance's prototype would link to the iframe's `ArrayBuffer` class, not your `ArrayBuffer` class, and both of the above checks would fail to recognize it as an ArrayBuffer.\n2. They will state that `Object.create(ArrayBuffer.prototype)` is an `ArrayBuffer`, but it's not. It's just a regular object who's prototype has been set to `ArrayBuffer.prototype`.\n\nBoth of these issues can be solved with a helper function like this:\n\n```javascript\n// An isArrayBuffer() check that supports cross-realm ArrayBuffers.\nfunction isArrayBuffer(value) {\n  try {\n    // If you call an ArrayBuffer method, like .slice(),\n    // with a \"this\" value that's anything\n    // other than an ArrayBuffer, a TypeError is thrown.\n    ArrayBuffer.prototype.slice.call(value, 0, 0);\n    return true;\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error instanceof TypeError) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you additionally need to ensure that you are not receiving an ArrayBuffer instance from an inherited class, you'd also need to walk up the prototype chain. You can modify the above example and replace `return true;` with the following:\n\n```javascript\n// A ArrayBuffer's prototype's chain should be\n// value -> ArrayBuffer.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null\n// If it's not, then we're dealing with an ArrayBuffer subclass.\nconst protoOf = Object.getPrototypeOf;\nreturn protoOf(protoOf(protoOf(value))) === null;\n```\n\nLodash's `_.isArrayBuffer()` also supports cross-realm ArrayBuffer checks, but it uses a less robust algorithm that can be easily fooled. For example, if you run Lodash in the browser, the following will return the wrong answer.\n\n```javascript\n_.isArrayBuffer({ get [Symbol.toStringTag]() { return 'ArrayBuffer' } }); // true\n```\n\nIn Node, Lodash will instead use `require('util').types.isArrayBuffer(value)` for it's implementation, which you are also welcome to use if you know your code will only run in Node.\n\nSome very early JavaScript proposals may provide support for more ergonomic ways to do cross-realm type checking:\n* [istypes](https://github.com/jasnell/proposal-istypes)\n* [Pattern matching's built-in matchers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching#built-in-custom-matchers-1)\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isArrayLike","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isArrayLike(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isArrayLike","summary":"Checks if `value` is array-like.

This means that even `{}` is \"array-like\", because it's able to get the (non-existent) length property (`undefined`), then coerce that into an integer (`0`). This definition technically makes almost any value except undefined, null, and a couple of other minor edge cases \"array-like\".

This distinction is technically nonsense. Only containers can be empty. If your piece of data can't hold anything, then it _can't_ be empty or non-empty, instead it's simply an invalid input. It's true that a `null` or `undefined` can be used to represent the absence of a value, but these pieces of data aren't in-and-of-themselves _empty_.

The reason for this odd behavior is simply because this function has been overloaded with too many behaviors - while it's true that `{ length: 0 }` is an empty array-like object, it's also true that this is not an empty object, and Lodash has decided to let the \"is this an empty object\" behavior take precedence over the \"is this an empty array-like value\" behavior for this specific scenario.

Some probing shows that it's an instance of an internal \"Stack\" class that provides some methods which, presumably, can be used to gather information about the objects you're comparing. Due to the fact that this seems to be a rather complex feature that's entirely undocumented, it'll be assumed that the vast majority of users do not use this parameter, and so it's functionality won't be recreated here either.\n\nSpecial data types, like Maps and Sets, are not supported in the above example. This is partly because Lodash chooses to support them in a slightly odd way that you may not wish to mirror. For example:\n* The fourth or fifth argument to your customizer function is supposed to be the parent node, but if that parent node was a `Map` or `Set` instance, you'll instead receive arrays containing the node's contents (e.g. a map of usernames to ids would be turned into `[['Sally', 1], ['Zack', 2]]` before being provided to you).\n* When comparing two sets, like `new Set([1, 2, 3, 4])` and `new Set([5, 6, 7, 8])`, its going to call your `customizer` function _16_ different times (assuming the `customizer` function returns `false` or `undefined` each time). As your sets grow in length, the amount of times it has to call your customizer grows exponentially. Maps have a similar issue. This behavior is required to implement the general-purpose algorithm Lodash was going for, but maybe for your use-case you don't need your algorithm to be so general-purpose - maybe you can cut some corners to help with performance.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isError","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isError(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isError","summary":"Checks if value is an `Error`, `EvalError`, `RangeError`, `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, or `URIError` object."},"description":"Lodash's documentation makes it sound like they're checking if the value is specifically an instance of a set of built-in errors, but in reality, they're considering any [non-plain object](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isPlainObject) that has `message` and `name` properties that are strings to be errors.

This is likely due to the fact that many of Node's standard library functions are implemented in JavaScript itself.\n\nOn [Lodash's website](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNative) you'll also see a warning about how their `_.isNative()` functions are unable to tell the difference between a core.js function and a native one, so if it detects that you are using core.js, their `_.isNative()` will always throw. The above `isNative()` is also unable to tell the difference between a core.js polyfilled function and a native one.\n\nEvery code snippet provided in Snap.js is operating under the assumption that the standard library is pristine and untouched, and the above `isNative()` operates under the same assumption. As long as no one is monkey-patching the standard library, the `isNative()` function will work with any modern JavaScript engine just fine and can't be spoofed. The reason Core.js is capable of getting around these checks is because it monkey-patches `Function.prototype.toString` and replaces it with its own implementation. If you're worried about running in an environment where monkey-patching might be happening, the correct way to handle this (for any of the snap.js functions, and any code you write in general) is to locally cache the built-in functions you need when your code first loads. Then, as long as your library is imported before any monkey-patching happens, your code won't be affected by the monkey-patching at all. If your library loads after monkey patching has happened, then all bets are off - you just have to trust that your host was responsible with how they've been messing with the globals.\n\nHere's an example of how you can make the `isNative()` function in a more robust manner, so that if this module loads before core-js (or any other library that messes with the globals), it'll still work just fine. (Writing robust code as shown above adds a big toll on the readability and maintainability of your codebase - only use techniques like this when it's actually necessary).\n\n```javascript\nconst callBind = fn => fn.call.bind(fn);\n\nconst functionToString = callBind(Function.prototype.toString);\nconst regExpTest = callBind(RegExp.prototype.test);\n\nfunction isNative(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'function') {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const nativeFnPattern = /^function.*?\\(\\) \\{ \\[native code\\] \\}$/;\n  const valueAsString = functionToString(value);\n  return regExpTest(nativeFnPattern, valueAsString);\n}\n```\n\nLodash actually follows this robust code pattern throughout its library, it has just chosen to additionally check for the presence of core.js and throw an error if it found that core.js was loaded, just in case core.js loaded before lodash.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isNil","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isNil(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNil","summary":"Checks if `value` is `null` or `undefined`."},"description":"```javascript\nvalue == null;\n```\n\nIn general, you should never use loose equality (`==`) in JavaScript, however, many people like to make the comparison against `null` an exception to this rule because it's a convenient way to check for either `null` or `undefined` - a fairly common operation.\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to tailor to an audience who may be unfamiliar with the `== null` trick, the following would be the most explicit and easy-to-read way to go.\n\n```javascript\nvalue === null || value === undefined;\n```\n\nThere's also some who like using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to get similar behavior.\n\n```javascript\n(value ?? null) === null;\n```\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isNull","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isNull(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNull","summary":"Checks if `value` is `null`."},"description":"```javascript\nvalue === null\n```\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"isNumber","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.isNumber(value)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isNumber","summary":"Checks if `value` is classified as a `Number` primitive or object. **Note:** To exclude `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN`, which are classified as numbers, use the `_.isFinite` method."},"description":"To check if a value is a number primitive:\n\n```javascript\ntypeof value === 'number';\n```\n\nThe above should be good enough for the vast majority of use-cases.\n\nLodash will also check if the value is a number object. In practice, such objects should never be found in your codebase, and if someone ever tries to hand such an object to you you really ought to treat it the same way you would treat any other bad input (throw an error, or if you aren't explicitly trying to check for bad inputs just let your library fall over, the same way it would with any other bad input).\n\nTo check if something is specifically a number object (and not a primitive), use the following:\n\n```javascript\nvalue instanceof Number;\n```\n\nThis, however, doesn't work cross realm (i.e. a number object created from inside an iframe would fail this check). It also would incorrectly state that `Object.create(Number.prototype)` is a number object, when in reality, it's just a normal object who's prototype is set to `Number.prototype`. If you need to worry about these kinds of issues, use the following solution instead:\n\n```javascript\n// An isNumber() check that supports cross-realm Number instances.\n// This will check if `value` is a number primitive or object.\n// Returns `true` for values that inherit from `Number` as well.\nfunction isNumber(value) {\n  try {\n    // If you call this method with a \"this\" value that's anything\n    // other than a Number primitive or object, a TypeError is thrown.\n    Number.prototype.valueOf.call(value);\n    // Makes sure Number.prototype was not passed in.\n    const protoOf = Object.getPrototypeOf;\n    return protoOf(protoOf(value)) !== null;\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error instanceof TypeError) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLodash's `_.isNumber()` also supports cross-realm Number object checks, but it uses a less robust algorithm that can be easily fooled.

The ability to globally overwrite the `undefined` value was changed in ES5, removing this concern in modern browsers. Even back then, this concern was largely over-hyped - yes you can override the value of `undefined`, but you can also override `Array`, `Math`, `Object`, `Function`, `setTimeout`, and so on - if the code you write doesn't try to defend against these globals being overwritten, then it should not try to defend against `undefined` being overwritten either.\n\nSide rant: In case you didn't know, `void` is _not_ a function, it is a prefix operator with the same precedence as `!`, `await`, `typeof`, and so on. You don't try to pretend `await` is a function by always adding parentheses after it, do you? (`await(doSomeAsyncTask())`)? No. And you really don't need to do it with `void` either. Is there harm in pretending a prefix operator is a function? In general, yes, because it makes order of operations confusing - if we pretend that `await` is a function, then you might end up writing code such as `await(getUser(id)).username` that looks reasonable, except it's not going to work - `getUser(...)` is going to return a promise, and then it's going to try to access the `username` property on that promise _before_ the `await` happens, which is not what the author intended. Is it bad to pretend that `void`, specifically, is a function instead of an operator. Well, technically no, there's no reasonable code that you would write using `void` where order of operations would get confusing, at least in the language as it stands today.

These can be used to convert a variety of different values, including bigint, booleans, strings, etc.\n\nIf you are converting a string to a number, you will likely want to additionally compare your string against a regular expression to make sure it is in the format you expect it to be in. The following are some strings that `Number()` will happily parse for you, that you might want to prevent with your regular expression:\n* Strings containing numbers with leading and/or trailing spaces (e.g. `Number('  23  ') === 23`)\n* Decimal number (e.g. `Number('2.3') === 2.3` or `Number('2.3E+5') === 2.3E+5`)\n* Scientific notation (e.g. `Number('2e3') === 2e3`)\n* Numbers in different basis (e.g. `Number('0x2a') === 0x2a`, `Number('0o47') === 0o47`, or `Number('0b101') === 0b101`)\n* Empty strings and white-space-only strings (e.g. `Number(' \\t \\n ') === 0`)\n* Numbers with a sign (e.g. `Number('-2') === -2` or `Number('+2') === +2`)\n* Infinity and -Infinity? (e.g. `Number('-Infinity') === -Infinity`)\n* Leading zeros? (e.g. `Number('012') === 12`)\n\nAs a concrete example, if you are receiving user input, and you only want to allow integer inputs (and you are ok with leading zeros), you can use a function like the following to get your desired behavior:\n\n```javascript\nfunction parseUserInput(value) {\n  // Ensures the string only contains digits and nothing else.\n  if (!value.match(/^\\d+$/)) {\n    throw new Error('Invalid user input');\n  }\n\n  const parsedValue = Number(value);\n\n  if (Number.isNaN(parsedValue)) {\n    throw new Error('Invalid user input');\n  }\n\n  return parsedValue;\n}\n```\n\n## What about parseInt() and parseFloat()?\n\nYou are welcome to use either of these functions as well for string-to-number conversions. These two functions follow their own different algorithms for parsing numbers that may or may not align with what you need. One unfortunate design decision to be aware of with these functions is the fact that as soon as they come across an invalid character, instead of returning an error value (`NaN`), they just parse what they can and return a number. This means, for example, `parseInt('2e7')` will unintuitively return the number `2`, because it doesn't know how to parse the `e`. All this really means is that it is even more important to use some up-front checking with a regular expression to ensure your string is formatted the way you would expect before handing the string off to `parseInt()` or `parseFloat()` to parse. It is also for this reason that I prefer using `Number()` over `parseInt()`/`parseFloat()` - `Number()` is less likely to surprise you with an unexpected result.\n","src":null,"test":""}]},{"categoryHeading":"Math","entries":[{"name":"add","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.add(augend, addend)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#add","summary":"Adds two numbers."},"description":"```javascript\naugend + addend;\n```\n\nOne reason `_.add()` exists, is because it's a ready-made function, that can easily be passed into other functions, like this:\n\n```javascript\n> _.reduce([2, 3, 4], _.add);\n9\n```\n\nWhen Lodash was first born, the only alternative at the time would be to create an entire function, using the `function` keyword.\n\n```javascript\n_.reduce([2, 3, 4], function (a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n});\n```\n\nSince then, ES6 came out with arrow functions, allowing you to define these sorts of functions in a much more concise way.\n\n```javascript\n_.reduce([2, 3, 4], (a, b) => a + b);\n```\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"ceil","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.ceil(number, precision?)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#ceil","summary":"Computes `number` rounded up to `precision`."},"description":"If you don't need to use the optional precision argument, then you can simply use the following:\n\n```javascript\nMath.ceil(number);\n```\n\nOtherwise:\n\n```javascript\nfunction ceil(number, precision=0) {\n  const factor = 10**precision;\n  return Math.ceil(number * factor) / factor;\n}\n```","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"divide","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.divide(dividend, divisor)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#divide","summary":"Divide two numbers."},"description":"```javascript\naugend / addend;\n```\n\nOne reason `_.divide()` exists, is because it's a ready-made function, that can easily be passed into other functions, like this:\n\n```javascript\n> _.reduce([100, 2, 5], _.divide);\n10\n```\n\nWhen Lodash was first born, the only alternative at the time would be to create an entire function, using the `function` keyword.\n\n```javascript\n_.reduce([100, 2, 5], function (a, b) {\n  return a / b;\n});\n```\n\nSince then, ES6 came out with arrow functions, allowing you to define these sorts of functions in a much more concise way.\n\n```javascript\n_.reduce([100, 2, 5], (a, b) => a / b);\n```\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"floor","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.floor(number, precision?)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#floor","summary":"Computes `number` rounded down to `precision`."},"description":"If you don't need to use the optional precision argument, then you can simply use the following:\n\n```javascript\nMath.floor(number);\n```\n\nOtherwise:\n\n```javascript\nfunction floor(number, precision=0) {\n  const factor = 10**precision;\n  return Math.floor(number * factor) / factor;\n}\n```","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"max","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.max(array)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#max","summary":"Computes the maximum value of array.

In Lodash's version, if you provide a falsey value, `undefined` will be returned. In JavaScript, if you try to spread a falsey value into `Math.max()`, you'll get a runtime error, because falsey values aren't iterable. In practice, this difference shouldn't matter much - you should know the types of values you're trying to use, and if you suspect that it might be falsey, just check for that before calling `Math.max()`, instead of checking if the result is undefined after calling `_.max()`.\n\n2.

This was done, among other reasons, to guard against the case where someone may have improperly mutated `Object.prototype`, and added an enumerable property to it. This `for-in` + `is-own` check isn't seen as much in the wild anymore, because the language has since come out with a better way to iterate over non-inherited keys, which is discussed in the `_.forOwn()` entry.\n\nIf you just want to iterate over object keys, and don't want to worry about inherited properties or the ordering of keys, look at `_.forOwn()` instead.\n","src":null,"test":""},{"name":"forOwn","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.forOwn(object, iteratee?)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#forOwn","summary":"Iterates over own enumerable string keyed properties of an object and invokes `iteratee` for each property.

Afterwords, all stray accent characters are removed with the `.replace()` call.\n\nThe NFKD \"compatibility normalization\" algorithm will also normalize multiple characters that are supposed to represent the same abstract character, for example, a D in a circle (\"Ⓓ\") will be normalized into a normal \"D\". A circled C (\"Ⓒ\") would likewise be normalized into a \"C\", however, the copyright symbol (\"©\") (which is a different code point from a circled C) will not be normalized into a \"C\", because, conceptually, the copyright symbol isn't intended to simply be a variation on the character \"C\".\n\nDepending on your use-case, you may find the NFD \"Canonical Decomposition\" algorithm to be a more appropriate choice. This algorithm will only normalize characters that are literally the same but have multiple representations. For example, the \"ñ\" character is a single code point while the \"ñ\" character is an \"n\" followed by a tilde modifier - since these are just two different ways to represent the exact same character, they'll be normalized by the \"Canonical Decomposition\" algorithm into the decomposed variant - the \"n\" followed by a tilde modifier.\n\n[Learn more about normalization algorithms, including other available algorithms on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize).\n\nThe above `deburr()` implementation isn't exactly the same as Lodash's.

Or would an alternative, less-error-prone solution work instead? There are valid reasons to need a function like `_.escape()`, but there are also some coding styles that force you to use it much more often than necessary. For example, perhaps you like to build your webpages via string interpolation and `.innerHTML`, such as in the following:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.body.innerHTML = `<p>${_.escape(userSuppliedString)}</p>`;\n```\n\nThis has the appearance of being simple and concise, but managing when and how to use `_.escape()` can be error-prone. There are a number of alternative solutions out there that remove many of these pitfalls (but not all, so you still need to look out for XSS vunerabilities no matter how you code). For example, you can use the browser APIs to manually build up your HTML instead of using string manipulation + `.innerHTML`.\n\n```javascript\nconst paragraph = document.createElement('p');\n// .innerText will automatically escape HTML characters for you.\nparagraph.innerText = userSuppliedString;\ndocument.body.replaceWith(paragraph);\n```\n\nIf you find this APIs to be cumbersome to use, you may enjoy [a little helper function](#!/utils/el) to make using it more tolerable.\n\nOr you can consider installing a third-party tool such as [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) for a simple templating library or [Lit](https://lit.dev/) for a mini framework.\n\nOr if you don't want to add an installation step to your project, you can copy some or all of the [Snap Framework](#!/framework) (The `html` template tag is especially useful for solving this problem).\n\nAll of these options will provide ways to auto-escape user-input for you, allowing you to focus more on UI building and less on data sanitization.\n","src":null,"test":"function escapeHtmlChars(string) {\n  return string\n    .replaceAll('&', '&amp;')\n    .replaceAll('<', '&lt;')\n    .replaceAll('>', '&gt;')\n    .replaceAll('\"', '&quot;')\n    .replaceAll(\"'\", '&#39;');\n}\n\ndescribe('escapeHtmlChars()', () => {\n  it('escapes all characters', () => {\n    const res = escapeHtmlChars('&<>\"\\'');\n    expect(res).toEqual('&amp;&lt;&gt;&quot;&#39;');\n  });\n\n  it('escapes all instances', () => {\n    const res = escapeHtmlChars('&<&<&');\n    expect(res).toEqual('&amp;&lt;&amp;&lt;&amp;');\n  });\n\n  it(\"doesn't panic on the empty string\", () => {\n    expect(escapeHtmlChars('')).toEqual('');\n  });\n});\n"},{"name":"lowerCase","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.lowerCase(string)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#lowerCase","summary":"Converts `string`, as space separated words, to lower case."},"description":"```javascript\nfunction lowerCase(string) {\n  const words = string.split(/\\s+/);\n  return words.map(word => word.toLowerCase()).join(' ');\n}\n```\n\nThe above generates the word list by simply splitting on whitespace characters.

This solution isn't perfect - read [this great post for a more nuanced exploration on internationalization and casing](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53930826/7696223).\n\nFor reference, Lodash's algorithm is implemented roughly as follows:\n* [Deburr](#!/nolodash/deburr) the string (which mostly means that accent marks are removed from characters).\n* Removes apostrophes (the ' and ’ characters).\n* Split the string into words using the algorithm that powers [`_.words()`](#!/nolodash/words).\n* upper case each word with `.toUpperCase()`.","src":null,"test":"describe('upperCase()', () => {\n  function upperCase(string) {\n    const words = string.split(/\\s+/);\n    return words.map(word => word.toUpperCase()).join(' ');\n  }\n\n  it('converts the words from the supplied string into upper-case', () => {\n    expect(upperCase('HELLO    aWeSoMe\\nworld')).toEqual('HELLO AWESOME WORLD');\n  });\n\n  it('handles an empty string', () => {\n    expect(upperCase('')).toEqual('');\n  });\n});\n"},{"name":"upperFirst","manifest":{"fnSignature":"_.upperFirst(string)","lodashLink":"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#upperFirst","summary":"Converts the first character of `string` to upper case."},"description":"```javascript\nfunction upperFirst([first='', ...rest]) {\n  return first.toUpperCase() + rest.join('');\n}\n```\n\nThe above implementation is carefully implemented to rely on the iterator protocol to split the string into separate characters (destructuring syntax uses the iterator protocol under the hood). This is done because iteration will properly split a string into characters while string indexing and slicing can cause you to accidentally split a string in between a character (e.g. `const firstChar = '🚀🚀'[0];` produces an invalid character while `const [firstChar] = '🚀🚀';` will properly retrieve the first character as `🚀`).\n\nIf you need to support internationalization, swap `.toUpperCase()` with [`.toLocalUpperCase()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLocaleUpperCase), and, if needed, provide the target language as an argument.

You can alternatively use one of these as an argument instead:\n* `/ +/` - split on one or more spaces. This will correctly split the string `\"a    b\"` into `[\"a\", \"b\"]`.\n* `/\\s+/` - split on one or more white-space characters (spaces, new lines, etc).\n* `/[^a-zA-Z0-9]+/` - split on any non-alpha-numeric text.\n\nIf you need a more robust solution that's language-sensitive, consider using [`Intl.Segmenter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Segmenter) instead.\n\n```javascript\nconst str = '吾輩は猫である。名前はたぬき。';\nconst segmenterJa = new Intl.Segmenter('ja-JP', { granularity: 'word' });\n\nconsole.log(\n  [...segmenterJa.segment(str)]\n    .filter(segmentInfo => segmentInfo.isWordLike)\n    .map(segmentInfo => segmentInfo.segment)\n);\n// => ['吾輩', 'は', '猫', 'で', 'ある', '名前', 'は', 'たぬき']\n```\n\nLodash attempts to get fancy with how it determines whether or not something should be considered a word or not, but it doesn't do as good of a job as `Intl.Segmenter()` (which wasn't available when Lodash was being created). As always, remember that language is messy and even `Intl.Segmenter()` isn't a perfect solution, but it is the best option that's natively available.\n\nLodash also lets you define what a word is via a pattern argument to `_.words()`. Using the pattern argument is really the same as doing `string.match(pattern) ?? []`. (This is different from doing `string.split(pattern)` in that the regular expression needs to define what characters are inside of a word, instead of defining what characters are between the words).\n\n```javascript\n'fred, barney, & pebbles'.match(/[^, ]+/g) ?? []\n// => [ 'fred', 'barney', '&', 'pebbles' ]\n```\n","src":null,"test":""}]}]
